# Jenkins Vagant

When wanting to run jenkins, but as a VM first before moving to docker.  It's a bit old fashioned
but good for learning which is the only real intention for this VM

## Usage

To use:

```bash
vagrant up
```

Go to Jenkins on http://localhost:8888

To destroy:

```bash
vagrant destroy --force
```
